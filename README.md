# OpenShell Community

[OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) is the runtime environment for autonomous agents -- the infrastructure where they live, work, and verify. It provides a programmable factory where agents can spin up physics simulations to master tasks, generate synthetic data to fix edge cases, and safely iterate through thousands of failures in isolated sandboxes. The core engine includes the sandbox runtime, policy engine, gateway (with k3s harness), privacy router, and CLI.

This repo is the community ecosystem around OpenShell -- a hub for contributed skills, sandbox images, launchables, and integrations that extend its capabilities. For the core engine, docs, and published artifacts (PyPI, containers, binaries), see the [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) repo.

| `sandboxes/` | Pre-built sandbox images for domain-specific workloads (each with its own skills) |

### Sandboxes

| Sandbox                 | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sandboxes/base/`       | Foundational image with system tools, users, and dev environment |
| `sandboxes/sdg/`        | Synthetic data generation workflows                          |
| `sandboxes/openclaw/`   | OpenClaw -- open agent manipulation and control              |
| `sandboxes/simulation/` | General-purpose simulation sandboxes                         |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenShell CLI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) installed (`uv pip install openshell`)
- Docker or a compatible container runtime
- NVIDIA GPU with appropriate drivers (for GPU-accelerated images)

### Quick Start with Brev

Skip the setup and launch OpenShell Community on a fully configured Brev instance, whether you want to use Brev as a remote OpenShell gateway with or without GPU accelerators, or as an all-in-one playground for sandboxes, inference, and UI workflows.

| Instance | Best For | Deploy |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| CPU-only | Remote OpenShell gateway deployments, external inference endpoints, remote APIs, and lighter-weight sandbox workflows | <a href="https://brev.nvidia.com/"><img src="https://brev-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nv-lb-dark.svg" alt="Deploy on Brev" height="40"/></a> |
| NVIDIA H100 | All-in-one OpenShell playgrounds, locally hosted LLM endpoints, GPU-heavy sandboxes, and higher-throughput agent workloads | <a href="https://brev.nvidia.com/"><img src="https://brev-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nv-lb-dark.svg" alt="Deploy on Brev" height="40"/></a> |

After the Brev instance is ready, access the Welcome UI to inject provider keys and access your Openclaw sandbox.

### Using Sandboxes

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from openclaw
```

The `--from` flag accepts any sandbox defined under `sandboxes/` (e.g., `openclaw`, `sdg`, `simulation`), a local path, or a container image reference.
